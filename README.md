# Spring Boot JPA Repository Testing
Spring Boot is the most popular framework to develop RESTful Services. It has awesome unit testing capabilities through Spring Boot Starter Test.

I learned to build unit tests for simple RESTful Services with Spring Boot Starter Test. I have learned to write independent unit tests for RESTful web services talking with multiple layers - web, business and data. I have learned how to write integration tests using MySQL Database.

I used Spring (Dependency Management), Spring Boot, Maven (dependencies management), IntelliJ (IDE), MySQL Database and Tomcat Embedded Web Server.

I have learned to use the most important Unit Testing Annotations - @SpringBootTest, @DataJpaTest.
